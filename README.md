# ⚡️ Django-Ecommerce-Function-Based-Views

This repo's code is as same as <a href="https://github.com/Nisarg1112/Django-Ecommerce-Website">**This repo's**</a> 😛.<br>
The only difference is, current repo's code has been written using Function Based Views (FBV) while <a href="https://github.com/Nisarg1112/Django-Ecommerce-Website">This repo's</a> code is being written using Class Based Views (CBV).

While I was learning Django, I started with Function Based views, So as an **Immuture developer**, I wrote current repo's code 😂😂

<a href="https://github.com/Nisarg1112/Django-Ecommerce-Website">**This repo's** </a>code is being written very neatly, You can check it out. You coders gonna love it for sure 😍❤️️.
